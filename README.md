# SPF_Generator
The SPF Generator is a web application that allows users to generate SPF (Sender Policy Framework) records for their domains. SPF records are used to specify which mail servers are authorized to send emails on behalf of a domain, helping to prevent email spoofing and improve email deliverability.
